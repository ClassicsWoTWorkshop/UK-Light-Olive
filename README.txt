Thank you for downloading!

To install:
- Drag the "gui" and "vehicles" folders from "MAIN MOD (Install this FIRST)" to <Your WoT Directory>\res_mods\<version> (EXAMPLE: C:\Games\World_of_Tanks\res_mods\0.9.20.0).

Optional:
- If you want to also remove the skin from the Cromwell Berlin, drag the .wotmod file from inside the "ADDON - Plain Cromwell B Skin (by Avalon304)" folder to <your WoT folder>\mods\<version> (example: C:\Games\World_of_Tanks\mods\0.9.20.0). Thanks to Avalon304 for making them, and for giving me permission to include them as an addon in this pack. :)
- Additionally, if you want to apply countershading to the Firefly's barrel, drag the "vehicles" folder from "ADDON - Firefly Barrel Countershading (by Desyatnik_Pansy)" to <Your WoT Directory>\res_mods\<version> (EXAMPLE: C:\Games\World_of_Tanks\res_mods\0.9.20.0).

Enjoy!
