Thank you for downloading!

To install:
- Drag the files from inside the MAIN MOD - COLOR CHANGE folder to your World of Tanks install directory (by default, C:\Games\World_of_Tanks).
Optional:
- If you want to also remove the skin from the Cromwell Berlin, drag the .wotmod file from inside the ADDON - PLAIN BERLIN VEHICLE SKINS (by Avalon304) folder to <your WoT folder>\mods\<version> (example: C:\Games\World_of_Tanks\mods\0.9.19.0.2). Thanks to Avalon304 for making them, and for giving me permission to include them as an addon in this pack. :)

IMPORTANT NOTE: Only the tanks that are currently in HD have the color swap. The non-HD tanks still have their default desert tan color. Since WG is going to rework them into HD at some point anyways, I'd rather not have to re-do the mod twice for those tanks. Plus, the color shows up weird since they use the old model/texture system.

Enjoy!
